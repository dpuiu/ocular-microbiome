The Ocular Microbiome Consortium (OMC) was launched by the `National Eye Institute <https://www.nei.nih.gov/>`_  in July 2023. The project supports five centers distributed across multiple universities that are collecting data to investigate the microbial composition on the surface of the human eye.

The OMC is sponsored in part by NIH grant U24-EY035078.

This research makes use of the `SciServer <https://www.sciserver.org/>`_ science platform. SciServer is a collaborative research environment for large-scale, data-driven science, sponsored in part by NIH grant U24-EY035078. It is being developed at, and administered by, the Institute for Data-Intensive Engineering and Science at Johns Hopkins University.
